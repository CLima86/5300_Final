# 5300_Final
Jupyter notebooks for Physics 5300 @ Ohio State University.

These notebooks are all originally built by the instructor in Physics 5300. They are merely instructional, and I only
claim to make original changes to "copies" of notebooks. These notebooks are specifically for the course final project.
